# COMP228 - LAB2 ASSIGNMENT README FILE ðŸš€

This repository contains Java solutions for three exercises designed to enhance your programming skills. Below you'll find descriptions of each exercise along with instructions on how to run the programs.

## Exercise 1: Test Simulator

In this exercise, you'll find a Java application that simulates a test. It includes the following features:

- Five multiple-choice questions based on the first three lectures of the course.
- A `Test` class with programmer-defined methods for simulating questions, checking answers, generating messages, and interacting with the user.
- Questions displayed using the `JOptionPane` class.
- Random congratulatory or corrective messages for user responses.
- Display of correct and incorrect answers, along with the percentage of correct answers at the end of the test.

To run the test simulator, simply create a `Test` object and start the test by calling the `inputAnswer` method from the main class.

## Exercise 2: Lotto Game

In this exercise, you'll find a `Lotto` class designed to simulate a simple lotto game. Here's what it includes:

- The `Lotto` class with an array instance variable to hold three random integer values between 1 and 9.
- A constructor that randomly populates the array for a `Lotto` object.
- A method to return the array.
- Interaction with the user using `JOptionPane` methods.

To play the lotto game, the user chooses a number between 3 and 27. The lotto runs up to 5 times, and each time the sum of the lotto numbers is calculated. If the user's chosen number matches the sum, the user wins; otherwise, the computer wins if there's no match within five rolls.

## Exercise 3: Overloaded Methods

This exercise involves writing a Java class with three overloaded static methods. Here's what it includes:

- Three overloaded static methods with different sets of parameters performing similar functionalities.
- Calling these methods within the `main` method and displaying the results.

To run this exercise, simply call the methods within the `main` method and observe the results.

## Running the Programs

To run each exercise:

1. Compile the Java files.
2. Execute the compiled files, ensuring that you have Java installed on your system.
